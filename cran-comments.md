I added new functions and new functionality.

The only reverse dependency is another package of mine.

## Test environments
* local Windows 7 install, R 3.6.0
* ubuntu 14.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.6.0
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.

## Reverse dependencies

This is a new release, so there are no reverse dependencies.
